\section{Idea}
With the emergence of the Web2.0 came a staggering increase of online reviews for, amongst others, movies. Reviews on the web often appear shortly after a movie's cinema release, possibly already during the movie's opening night on social media like Twitter. Existing research on the applicability of movie sentiment \cite{Mishne2006, Liu2007, Asur2010} often takes into account a single social medium or blogging platform. The release of the Common Crawl\footnote{commoncrawl.org} data set allows us to perform research the applicability of movie sentiments on a large crawl of the web. 

Yu et al \cite{Yu2012} showed sentiments in online movie reviews to have a significant impact on future sales performance. Therefore online movie reviews are of great importance to the movie industry.

\section{Method}
Socher et al \cite{Socher2013} made their recursive neural tensor network sentence-level sentiment analysis model for predicting review sentiment publicly available as part of the StanfordNLP.
